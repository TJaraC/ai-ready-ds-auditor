# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Any Non-Enterprise Figma user can connect their Design System to a local AI IDE in under 5 minutes, get live sync indicators, and give the AI full structured context — for free.
**Current focus:** Milestone v2.0 — execute Phase 7

## Current Position

**Phase:** 7 of 12 — Architecture Refactor (COMPLETE)
**Plan:** 4/4 plans complete
**Status:** Ready to plan
**Last Activity:** 2026-03-10

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0 baseline):**
- Total plans completed: 15
- Average duration: ~20 min/plan
- Total execution time: ~5 hours

*v2.0 metrics will populate as plans complete*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions (carried from v1.0)

- Vite as plugin bundler — ✓ Good
- React for Plugin UI — ✓ Good
- In-memory cache in MCP Server — ✓ Good (6 req/month free tier)
- Chunking threshold at 90kB — ✓ Good
- CJS for MCP server (ESM resolution issues with shared) — ✓ Good
- `unknown` cast over `any` — ✓ Good
- icon field NOT in manifest.json — ✓ Good

### Decisions (from Phase 6 → implemented in Phase 7)

- ARCH-01: Auditors accept `AuditNode*` interfaces, not Figma nodes → `audit/inputs.ts` — DONE (07-01)
- ARCH-02: `serializeReport()` extracted to `serialize.ts` — pure, no Figma dep — DONE (07-02)
- ARCH-03: MCP adapter in `adapter.ts` — pure transforms, no MCP SDK imports — DONE (07-03); adapter wiring deferred to Phase 11
- ARCH-04: Chunk reader split into `assembleChunks()` + `parseReport()` — DONE (07-03); reconstructReport() is backward-compatible wrapper
- ARCH-05: UI state in `state.ts` + `useAppMessages.ts` — zero-React, zero-Figma — DONE (07-04)
- useReducer replaces 8 useState in App.tsx; message listener isolated in useAppMessages hook

### Key v1.0 Technical Notes

- TextEncoder via (globalThis as unknown as { TextEncoder?: ... })
- Chunk splitting by character count (81,000 chars), ai_data_meta written LAST
- setPluginData(key, '') is Figma deletion pattern
- figma.loadAllPagesAsync() required before documentchange handler
- optional catch binding (catch {}) rejected by Figma parser — use typeof guard
- cornerRadius figma.mixed skipped — future improvement
- pluginData accessed via fileResponse.document.pluginData ?? {}

### Key v2.0 Technical Notes (Phase 7)

- Figma global mock for tests: `(globalThis as Record<string, unknown>).figma = { mixed: Symbol('figma.mixed') }` — before auditor imports
- noUncheckedIndexedAccess: use `arr[i]!` after `expect(arr).toHaveLength(n)` in tests
- auditTypography: guard `undefined` explicitly on optional fields before checking `!== figma.mixed`

### Blockers/Concerns

None — Phase 6 resolved both blockers.

### Pending Todos

None.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-03-10T12:19:53.095Z
**Stopped at:** Completed 07-02-PLAN.md — auditor tests + serializeReport() extraction
**Next action:** Phase 7 complete — ready to plan next phase
